# Survey Feedback Api

## üìù Description

A simple backend API built with Laravel 11 and PHP 8.4 for collecting feedback through surveys. Responders can register, log in, and submit answers to surveys using secure JWT authentication.

The API allows anyone to view active surveys and their questions, but only logged-in responders can submit responses.

The system follows RESTful design, includes proper data validation, rate limiting, caching with Redis, and logging.

## üîß Testing API Endpoints with REST Client

For testing and verifying the correct functionality of the API endpoints, a file named endpoint-examples.http is included in the project.

This file contains example HTTP requests that can be executed directly within Visual Studio code using the REST Client extension. This extension allows you to send HTTP requests and view responses directly in the editor, making endpoint testing simple and efficient.

### How to use:

1. Install the REST Client extension in Visual Studio Code.

2. Open the endpoint-examples.http file.

3. Select the HTTP request you want to test.
